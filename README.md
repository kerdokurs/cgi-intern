# CGI Internship Task

## Disclaimer

This web app uses formulas to approximate the times of sunrise and sunset. Hence the times could be a few minutes off the actual times.

## Features

- Getting sunrise and sunset times at a specific location (entered both by coordinates and from the map) and at a given time.
- Visualisation of the change in the length of the day.

## Running

- Navigate to the project folder and run `npm i`.
- For a **development** build, run `npm start` and the web app will open on port 8080. Keep in ming that the development build is not optimised and could have way worse performance than the production build.
- For a **production** build, first run `npm run build` to build the application. Then navigate to the `build` directory and open it with a simple server. Live-server has been tested and works well (to install and run it run `npm i -g live-server` followed by `live-server` in the build directory).

## Time consumption

The task took just around 7 hours to complete.
